This was our Final year project for the college. We were just eager to make this so we hyped this so much, but in the end as I am writing this 2nd of April 2024No team members are willing to work for it or even maintain it. The team is no longer together, so the maintainance is purely dependent on the contributers and me.

## What is Actually FusionDB?

This Project was a POC (Proof of Concept) for Serverless webpage serving, pure Python in working inside the browser. Hence reducing the need of an actual server and eliminating most of the cybersecurity threats in the cyberspace. But as a result the question comes,

**_How The heck do we add processing to it?  Native Js isn't that powerfull and all, That is why we need frameworks ike React, Node and in case of Python, Flask for right?_**

_That is why I proposed Pyscript!_

It adds the simplicity and the powerful nature of Python to web interfaces. Yes while it still is it's in its early stages and is heavily dependent on Pyodide, it is a great start. But realistically speaking the it only mitigates the need of just the front part of a website. While some websites may not need server-side processing, most of them do. That is why Pyodide never took off. But I fullheartedly believe that integrating with Python based back-ends could **_in future_** be seemlessly integrated into it and completely removing the need of javascript. Well still it is way far in the distance and pyodide is way far from finishing, but it is possible. Hence this project will stand as a pillar of making those possible.
